# The Coffee Pawz Find-a-Book Search Engine 

## Description 
This web application offers avid readers a new way to search for books to read and save books they are interested in. This web application utilizes the Google Books API and starter code. The starter code was built with RESTful API routes; the code in this repository took that starter code and refactored it to be a GraphQL engine with an Apollo Server. 

This web application also utilizes React, MongoDB, Node.js/Express.js server and API, and has been deployed using Heroku.
